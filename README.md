ngd
===

Angularjs directives focused on HTML

As the same way [ngmap](//allenhwkim.github.com/angularjs-google-maps) does, html tag and attributeevery should be enough to peroform simple DOM change, without using any javascript.

Principles of `ngd`
  
  # html first
    ## without looking at javascript code, you should be able to understand what's going on.
  # and, html first
  # finally, html first

For bower users, `bower install ngd`

Please see [the github page](http://allenhwkim.github.io/ngd) for usage.
